# The original

# Attention to detail:  "Hand drawing"


One thing that is so charming about this plot is the feeling that Bart Simpson has hand-drawn the figure.  

Gil writes: *I want the axes and the line connecting the points to look hand-drawn, so I will use geom_line + jitter to draw them*


---

# spline() to connect points

He uses the spline function, which makes a smooth connection between points, rather than sharp, as a human might do in a rush.


Here is the function: 

spline(x, y = NULL, n = 3*length(x), method = "fmm",
       xmin = min(x), xmax = max(x), xout, ties = mean)

And the description:

"Perform cubic (or Hermite) [spline interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation) of given data points, returning either a list of points obtained by the interpolation or a function performing the interpolation."


---

```{r shaky_hand, echo = F}
as.data.frame(spline(x = clean_data$season, 
                     y = clean_data$guests_per_episode, 
                     method = "natural")) ->
  spline_int
```

`r apply_reveal("shaky_hand")`


---

# "Hand drawn" axes with position_jitter()

Then Gil also creates mini datasets for hand drawn axes x and y.  He creates straight horizontal and vertical lines, segmented into small pieces.  He plots these mini data sets with geom_line where the position is jittered.   




---

```{r axes, echo = F}
data.frame(x = seq(from = 0, to = 30, by = 1), 
           y = rep(0, 31)) -> 
  drawn.x.axis
data.frame(x = rep(0, 21), 
           y = seq(from = 0, to = 4, by = 0.2)) -> 
  drawn.y.axis
```

# Changes from the [original](https://github.com/GilHenriques/TidyTuesdays) and notes to self


- I use [slow ggplot principles](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html#3) to provide maximal feedback for each step of the build. 
- Fonts are still tricky to manage across platforms and in the flipbook setting, so sadly I don't do anything with them, and a less charming plot results.
- I changed the text color to be off white instead of white, so that you can see it against the theme_void() white background
- There seems to be some problem with the display when there are list columns in data relates to square brackets. hmmmmm...
- This should be included in [TidyTuesday walk-throughs](https://evamaerey.github.io/tidytuesday_walk_through/tidytuesday_highlights.html#1) at some point.
